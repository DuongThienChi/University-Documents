<h3 id="android">Devices:</h3>

<p>
	If you want a physical Android device to develop on, but don't currently own one, there are lots of inexpensive ones you can purchase.
	I personally recommend buying a tablet rather than a phone, because Android phones tend to cost a LOT of money if you buy them without an actual cell phone contract.
	Here are some links to Android devices that I have personally bought and verified that they work for installing your own developed Android apps:
